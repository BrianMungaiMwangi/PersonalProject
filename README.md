Hello.
This is an EDA for a travel insurance data. This data was merged with a health insurance data for an extensive EDA.
This process begun by opening the two datasets.
I did the .info to find the unique identifier to merge the two datasets.
I had to rename the one specific column to be able to merge the two datasets.
After successful merging, I did a summary statistics using the .describe and general information using the .info
I noticed that the Gender column had NA values which would bring issues while doing EDA.
I had to replace the NA values with a value which I callled Unknown which now would make it possible for the EDA.
After this, I checked for duplicate entries and merged them together to get a clean dataset of the inital merged dataset.
I started doing analysis of the data as per the objectives of the projects.
This includes statistics, conclusions, results and visualizations of different findings of the dataset.
Bar charts, Pie charts and tables were used in the visualization.
Once this was done, a markdown was created to draw out conclusions, findings and summaries as per the objectives.
Thank you!
